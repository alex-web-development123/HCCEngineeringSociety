# HCC Engineering Society Website

The Engineering Society is a club at the Brandon campus of Hillsborough Community College (www.hccfl.edu/campus-life/brandon-campus) in Tampa, Florida.  You can find a repository for the website here:

The club sponsors a programming workshop that meets on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/RjquZWX).   In Discord, look for the programming channel.   We meet from 9:30 am to 10:30 on most Fridays.   But feel free to chat with us on our channel any time.

Currently the website is in a developmental stage.   It is running on a virtual Linux machine hosted by Digital Ocean.  The site uses the Flask web application framework (https://flask.palletsprojects.co).  It uses WSGI (https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to communicate to an NGINX (www.fullstackpython.com/nginx.html) webserver.

The plan is to gradually build up the website while learning Python, git, HTML, CSS, linux commands, Flask, Python, and Jinja.  We will coordinate our efforts with a workflow using git and GitHub.   

Right now we we need help with the following:
(1)  The home page.
(2)  An about page.
(3)  A calendar.
(4)  A page that show the various projects that the ES is working on.
(5)  A photo gallery.

Thank you to HCC's Brandon Campus Student Government Association for sponsoring our club!!!
